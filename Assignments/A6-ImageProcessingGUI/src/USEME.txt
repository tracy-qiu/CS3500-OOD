The image processor's Graphical User Interface(GUI) is used to visualize the image transformations.
The GUI has the same functionality as the previous command line argument processing but now offers
a display to select buttons for each image transformation. These include greyscale based on value,
luma, intensity, red, green, or blue components. There is also image processing for vertical flip,
horizontal flip, brighten, sepia, blur, and sharpen. Each of these image processing options
can be applied after loading in an image. When the load button is clicked, a file chooser pops up
to prompt the user for an input jpg, png, or bmp image file. Once selected, the image will pop up
on the GUI as well as the histogram that represents the frequency of each pixel intensity 0 - 255.
The x-axis represents the pixel intensities 0 - 255 and the y-axis represents the frequency of the
that pixel intensity. There are four lines on the histogram, red, green, blue, and intensity
represented with red, green, blue, and black lines respectively.

When each transformation button is selected, the image processing is applied to the image on the GUI
and updated the image and histogram. The brighten image processing is the only transformation that
requires an input. The text box below the brighten button prompts for an integer value to increase
or decrease the pixel values by the given amount. A positive value brightens the image, and a
negative value darkens the image. To save the image displayed on the GUI, the file chooser pops up
prompting the user to select a file destination. The exit button can be used to close the program.
